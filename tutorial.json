One of them is `games.csv`. It contains a comma-separated list of all games of the final three rounds of the World Cup tournement since 2010, the titles are at the top. It includes the year of each game, the round of the tournament the game was in, the winner, their opponenet, and the number of goals each team scored. You need to do three things for this project; create a database structure, create a script to insert all of the data from that file, and complete the `queries.sh` script to produce the correct output.\n\nLog into the psql interactive terminal with `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres`. Create your database structure with the interactive terminal. You can query the database in your script with `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=salon -c \"SQL QUERY HERE\"`, add more flags if you need to.\n\nMy tests will replace all instances of `worldcup` in your scripts with my own database to test against.\nHint: For your `insert_data.sh` get one insert working before trying to add the rest. Also, you may want to run a command at the start of the script to delete data that may have been created from previously running the script. I would suggest to make as few queries to the database as possible so your script is faster.",
