      "content": "You start with several files, one of them is `games.csv`. It contains a comma-separated list of all games of the final three rounds of the World Cup tournament since 2014; the titles are at the top. It includes the year of each game, the round of the game, the winner, their opponent, and the number of goals each team scored. You need to do three things for this project:\n\nLog into the psql interactive terminal with `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres` and create your database structure according to the user stories below. **Don't forget to connect to the database after you create it**.\n\nComplete the `insert_data.sh` script to correctly insert all the data from `games.csv` into the database. The file is started for you. Do not modify any of the code you start with. Using the `PSQL` variable defined, you can make database queries like this: `$($PSQL \"<query_here>\")`. The tests have a 20 second limit, so try to make your script efficient. The less you have to query the database, the faster it will be. You can empty the rows in the tables of your database with `TRUNCATE TABLE games, teams;`\n\nComplete the empty `echo` commands in the `queries.sh` file to produce output that matches the `example-output.txt` file. The file has some starter code, and the first query is completed for you. Use the `PSQL` variable defined to complete rest of the queries. Note that you need to have your database filled with the correct data from the script to get the correct results from your queries. Hint: Test your queries in the psql prompt first and then add them to the script file.\n\nIf you leave your virtual machine, you may lose your database. You can make a dump of it by entering `pg_dump --clean --create --inserts --username=freecodecamp worldcup > worldcup.sql` in a terminal (not the psql one). It will save the commands to rebuild your database in `worldcup.sql`. You can rebuild it by entering `psql -U postgres < worldcup.sql` in a terminal if you enter the command where the `.sql` file is.",
